# coding-gardners
Project 1 for Class

## Description
We decided we wanted to build a tool that would give people with budding gardening interests access to quick and easy information based on their USDA zone. This tool gives basic information on common fruits and vegetables grown west of the Mississippi along with a link that will take them to a page with growing instructions. We learned how to filter an array based off of certain attributes in an object. Also, learned was how to generate a list on its own based off of a selection made by a user and having it display the chosen object as an array with the previous selections as well.

## Installion Steps
No installation required - This is a web application!

## Usage
First select your USDA Zone, and then from there please select a plant from the plants provided in the dropdown. Hit Submit and Voila! The selected plant will appear on the side and the history of the three previous selections will be displayed as well so that you can see everything that was chosen recently!
